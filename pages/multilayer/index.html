<P class="p5 ft7"><IMG class="artistIcon" src="./assets/Remote%20Sensibility%20-%20International1xi2.jpg" id="inl_img1"><SPAN class="ft6"> Marten Berkman </SPAN>is a northern interdisciplinary visual artist working over ten years in stereoscopic media. Coming from a background in fine art and documentary photography and film making focused on wilderness and conservation, he constantly aspires to challenge and expand our vocabulary for describing human nature, the rest of nature, and the relationship between them. He lives upstream from Whitehorse, Yukon in Canada’s sub arctic.</P>

	<P class="p11 ft5">Description of Installation</P>
	<P class="p12 ft9">A short throw 3D HD projector, tied to a laptop computer and Kinect sensor, loops a video installation of many scenes of the Hart river in the Yukon’s subarctic Peel watershed. This is a pristine wilderness where disparate layers of meaning overlap in the same geography: resource extraction competing with ancient and inherent value in the land. Woven into the images of this wild habitat  are the textures of materials from our manufactured spaces. At select scenes, particles reflecting the viewers and their movements in the gallery space are projected directly into the stereoscopic representation of remote landscapes.  A sound scape accompanies the visuals.</P>
	<P class="p14 ft5">Description of Artistic Practice</P>
	<P class="p15 ft9">Remote Sensibility is the theme of my artistic practice in the subarctic where I live. Using parameters of stereo 3D imaging to compel a sense of presence in place, and software and sensors to reflect viewers in the landscapes they observe but may never know first hand, I wish to disrupt duality inherent in imaging of the earth. Using technology as a reflection of our nature, I am exploring how we see the rest of nature, and our relationship with it, from the vantage point of our manufactured spaces...a vigour which appears essential to the ecology of our perception.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_4" class="page">


<DIV id="id_1">
<P><h3>Background to the artistic practice</h3></P>
<P class="p24 ft3">Disruption of my own traditional photographic practice has been an essential part of my process in distilling imaging of the land and our relationship with it. As images of pristine landscapes devoid of humans continue to be used to sell conservation ideas and cars, I have wondered about the dichotomy that I am a part of perpetuating. What are the actual layers of meaning which overlap in the land, and how do we honestly reflect our own nature in it?</P>
<P class="p25 ft16">In arctic forays and the subarctic where I live, stereoscopy has become an essential colour on my palette to disrupt two dimensionality of my photo representation. The z axis is our sense of presence. The emotive and visceral experience the added dimension brings us compelled expanding the still image to moving tableaux of the remote landscapes we are a part of but which most of us never see first hand. In large scale video installation, my photography becomes the slow food of cinema, as viewers would spend many minutes observing nothing more than the grass swaying in the wind on an arctic outcrop.</P>
	<P class="p26 ft9">However the ultimate disruption for me has been to dissolve the separation of subject from object. I am confounded by the duality with nature that we perpetuate in images of it… the image perpetuates our own conditioning of separateness… the medium is an artifact, long removed from the cave walls of our ancestors where our canvas was part of the earth.</P>
	<P class="p26 ft9">Or is it so removed? What are technology and creativity but our very own nature, and hence inseparable from the rest of nature? Why is our technological nature so at odds with the rest of the living community? Is it that our perception is orphaned, that we no longer see the wall of the cave connected to the mountain and the river…as though our consciousness has not caught up to the means of perception we have crafted?</P>
	<P class="p26 ft9">To disrupt this separateness, I have been inspired to reflect the viewer in the landscapes so distant yet so inseparable from us. Working with my friend Baptiste Bohelay, fellow artist and highly skilled and playful interactive designer, we let the viewer find themselves in the stereoscopic imagery of remote landscapes: particles play in the land with our movement in the gallery space. The land is no longer an other, but a place which symbolically we are a part of. And in that symbolism, perhaps we begin to fathom the literalness of our relationship, as every calorie of energy, every metal, every plastic, comes from these distant places. These places are in fact now all around us, in the materials of our manufactured world.</P>
	<P class="p26 ft9">I am compelled to disrupt how we see the land and ourselves in it, to have a deeper and more vigorous perception of human nature, the rest of nature, and the relationship between us.</P>
